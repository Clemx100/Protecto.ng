# ✅ CHAT SYSTEM FIXED - MESSAGE SENDING NOW WORKS

## 🔧 What Was the Problem?

The `.env.local` file had **trailing spaces** after the Supabase API keys, causing:

1. **Cleaned `.env.local` file**
   - Removed all trailing spaces from API keys
   - Verified each line has correct length
   - No extra whitespace characters

2. **Environment Variables Now Clean:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://kifcevffaputepvpjpip.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ... (238 chars, no spaces)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ... (245 chars, no spaces)
   ```

3. **Server Restarted**
   - Fresh server process
   - Clean environment loaded
   - Database connection active
