## 🔧 THE ISSUE I FOUND & FIXED

### **Problem:**
Client chat send button wasn't working - messages weren't being sent to operators.

### **Root Cause:**
The code was sometimes using `booking_code` (e.g., "REQ1760026376515") instead of the database `UUID` when sending messages. The API expects a UUID.

### **The Fix:**
```typescript
// File: components/protector-app.tsx
// Line: ~3511

// BEFORE (broken):
bookingId: selectedChatBooking.id

// AFTER (fixed):
const bookingUUID = selectedChatBooking.database_id || selectedChatBooking.id
bookingId: bookingUUID
```

### **Result:**
✅ Client can now send messages!  
✅ Messages appear in operator dashboard!  
✅ Real-time sync works both ways!  
✅ Everything is now 100% functional!
