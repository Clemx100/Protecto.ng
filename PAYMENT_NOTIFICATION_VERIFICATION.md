# ✅ Payment Notification System - Verification Report

## 🔍 Code Review & Verification

### **1. URL Parameter Detection** ✅
**Location:** `components/protector-app.tsx` (lines 1026-1037)

**Code:**
```javascript
if (paymentStatus === 'success' && bookingId) {
  console.log('✅ Payment success detected in URL for booking:', bookingId)
  
  // Show success message
  alert('🎉 Payment Successful!\n\n...')
  
  // Switch to messages tab so user can see the confirmation
  setActiveTab('messages')
  
  // Clear URL parameters
  window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname)
  return
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY**
- Detects `?payment=success&booking={id}`
- Shows alert notification
- Auto-switches to Messages tab
- Cleans URL after notification

---

### **2. Paystack Callback Redirect** ✅
**Location:** `app/api/payments/paystack/callback/route.ts` (line 125)

**Code:**
```javascript
return NextResponse.redirect(
  new URL(`/?payment=success&booking=${bookingIdToUpdate}`, request.url)
)
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT FORMAT**
- Redirects to root path with parameters
- Includes booking ID for tracking
- Fixed from `/app` (404) to `/` (working)

```javascript
alert('⚠️ Payment Error\n\nThere was an error processing your payment.\n\n...')
```

## 🔒 Safety Checks

### **What Could Break?**

❌ **Early return issues:**
- Each payment status has `return` statement
- Prevents other URL handlers from running
- ✅ **SAFE:** Payment checks run first, before other params

❌ **useEffect dependency issues:**
- useEffect runs on mount
- No dependencies = runs once
- ✅ **SAFE:** Correct pattern for URL checking

❌ **Alert blocking:**
- Alert is synchronous (blocks execution)
- ✅ **SAFE:** User must click OK to proceed

❌ **State update before mount:**
- `setActiveTab('messages')` called during URL check
- ✅ **SAFE:** State updates are queued properly
