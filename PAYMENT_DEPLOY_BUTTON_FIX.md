# ✅ Payment Success - Deploy Team Button Fix

## 🐛 Critical Issue Found

**Problem:** After successful payment via Paystack, the "Deploy Team" button was NOT appearing in the operator dashboard.

**Root Cause:** The code was trying to update a `payment_approved` column in the database that **doesn't exist!**

**Error in Logs:**
```
❌ Failed to update booking status: {
  code: 'PGRST204',
  message: "Could not find the 'payment_approved' column of 'bookings' in the schema cache"
}
```

This meant:
1. ❌ Payment succeeded on Paystack
2. ❌ But booking status never updated to `'paid'`
3. ❌ So "Deploy Team" button never appeared
4. ❌ Operator was stuck!

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Core Fix:**

Instead of using a non-existent `payment_approved` column, we now **rely solely on the `status` field**.

When payment is successful:
- Status changes to `'paid'`
- Operator dashboard detects `status === 'paid'`
- "Deploy Team" button appears

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Fixed Payment Callback (Lines 67-83)**

**File:** `app/api/payments/paystack/callback/route.ts`

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
const { data: updatedBooking, error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .update({ 
    status: 'paid',
    payment_approved: true,  // ❌ Column doesn't exist!
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', bookingIdToUpdate)
  .select()
  .single()
```

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
const { data: updatedBooking, error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .update({ 
    status: 'paid',  // ✅ Just update status
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', bookingIdToUpdate)
  .select()
  .single()
```

---

### **2. Fixed Operator Dashboard Payment Detection**

**File:** `components/operator-dashboard.tsx`

**Changed Lines:**
- Line 350: `payment_approved: booking.status === 'paid'`
- Line 365: `paymentStatus[booking.id] = booking.status === 'paid'`
- Line 432: `payment_approved: booking.status === 'paid'`
- Line 632-633: Removed reference to `selectedBooking.payment_approved`

**Before:**
```typescript
payment_approved: booking.payment_approved || false  // ❌ Column doesn't exist!
```

**After:**
```typescript
payment_approved: booking.status === 'paid'  // ✅ Check status field!
```

---

### **3. Fixed Deploy Button Check (Lines 631-639)**

**Before:**
```typescript
const isPaymentConfirmed = paymentApproved[selectedBooking.id] || 
                           selectedBooking.status === 'paid' || 
                           selectedBooking.payment_approved === true  // ❌ Doesn't exist!
```

**After:**
```typescript
const isPaymentConfirmed = paymentApproved[selectedBooking.id] || 
                           selectedBooking.status === 'paid'  // ✅ Clean check!
```
