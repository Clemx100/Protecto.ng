## 🐛 Known Issues (Now Fixed!)

### ✅ **FIXED: Deploy Button Not Appearing**
**Problem:** Even after payment, deploy button didn't show
**Solution:** Callback now sets both `status='paid'` AND `payment_approved=true`

### ✅ **FIXED: Redirect to /app (404)**
**Problem:** Payment callback redirected to non-existent `/app` route
**Solution:** Changed redirect to `/?payment=success`

### ✅ **FIXED: Status 'paid' Not Recognized**
**Problem:** Dashboard didn't recognize `paid` status
**Solution:** Added `paid` to status handlers and colors

### ✅ **FIXED: Payment Check Too Strict**
**Problem:** Deploy only checked `paymentApproved` state
**Solution:** Now checks multiple sources (state, status, database field)
