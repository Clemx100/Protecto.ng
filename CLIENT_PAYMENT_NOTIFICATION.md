# How Clients Know Payment Has Been Confirmed

## 🔔 Client Notification System

When a client completes payment through Paystack, they are notified in **THREE ways**:

---

## 1. 🎉 **Success Alert (Immediate)**

After completing payment on Paystack:
- Client is automatically redirected back to your app
- URL contains: `/?payment=success&booking={bookingId}`
- App detects this and shows an alert:

```
🎉 Payment Successful!

Your payment has been received and confirmed.

Your protection service request is now being processed.

Check the Messages tab to view your payment confirmation.
```

- App automatically switches to **Messages tab**
- URL is cleaned (parameter removed)

---

## 2. 💬 **Chat System Message (Persistent)**

A system message is automatically sent to the booking's chat:

```
✅ Payment received! Amount: ₦XX,XXX

Reference: protector_xxx_xxx

Your protection service request is being processed.
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Persists in chat history
- ✅ Client can see it anytime
- ✅ Includes payment details (amount, reference)
- ✅ Available even after refresh

**Where client sees it:**
1. Click **Messages** tab
2. Select their booking
3. See the system message in chat

---

## 3. 📊 **Booking Status Update**

The booking status is updated in the database:
- Status changes to: `paid` 
- `payment_approved` flag set to `true`

**What client sees:**
- In their bookings list, status shows as **"PAID"**
- Operator can now deploy the protection team
- Service progresses to next stage

## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### **Payment Callback Route**
`/api/payments/paystack/callback/route.ts`

1. **Verifies payment** with Paystack API
2. **Updates booking:**
   ```javascript
   UPDATE bookings SET 
     status = 'paid',
     payment_approved = true
   ```
3. **Creates payment record** in database
4. **Sends system message** to chat
5. **Redirects client** with success parameter

### **Client App Component**
`components/protector-app.tsx`

On mount, checks URL parameters:
```javascript
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
const paymentStatus = urlParams.get('payment')
const bookingId = urlParams.get('booking')

if (paymentStatus === 'success') {
  // Show success alert
  // Switch to messages tab
  // Clear URL parameters
}
```
