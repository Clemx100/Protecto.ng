# 🧾 INVOICE SENDING - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## ✅ STATUS: WORKING CORRECTLY

The invoice sending functionality is **working perfectly**! The issue is that the operator needs to be properly logged in to send invoices.

---

## 🔍 DIAGNOSIS

### What I Found:
1. ✅ **Invoice API endpoint**: Working correctly
2. ✅ **Database integration**: Messages save properly
3. ✅ **Invoice data structure**: Correct format
4. ✅ **UI components**: Modal and buttons work
5. ❌ **Authentication**: Operator must be logged in

### The Issue:
The operator dashboard requires authentication to send invoices. When you click "Send Invoice" without being logged in, you get a 401 Unauthorized error.
