# Live Deployment Fixes - October 1, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: "Test User" Showing on Live Domain (www.protector.ng)

**Problem:**
All bookings were showing as "test user" because the booking creation API was using a hardcoded default test client ID for all new bookings.

**Root Cause:**
In `app/api/bookings/route.ts` line 25, there was a hardcoded client ID:
```typescript
const clientId = '4d2535f4-e7c7-4e06-b78a-469f68cc96be' // Default test client
```

**Solution:**
Modified the booking creation API to:
1. Extract actual client information from the booking data (email, phone, name)
2. Search for existing client profile in the database by email
3. Create a new guest profile if no existing profile found
4. Only use the default test client ID as a last resort fallback

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/bookings/route.ts` (lines 20-74)

**Result:**
Now all new bookings from the live domain will create or link to actual client profiles with their real information.

### Issue 2: 404 Error When Operator Clicks "Confirm" Button

**Problem:**
When operators clicked the "Confirm" action button, they received an error:
```
Failed to update booking status: HTTP 404: {"error":"Booking not found"}
```

**Root Cause:**
There was confusion between two ID fields:
- `booking_code` (display ID like "REQ123456")
- `id` (actual database UUID)

The operator dashboard was sometimes passing the `booking_code` instead of the actual database UUID to the status update endpoint.

**Solution:**
Enhanced the operator dashboard's `handleOperatorAction` function to:
1. Check if `database_id` is present and valid
2. If missing or looks like a booking code (starts with "REQ"), query the database to get the actual UUID
3. Use the correct UUID for the status update API call

**Files Modified:**
- `components/operator-dashboard.tsx` (lines 608-661)

**Result:**
The operator can now successfully confirm bookings and update their status without 404 errors.

### Bonus Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Operator Bookings API
**File:** `app/api/operator/bookings/route.ts`

Improved the operator bookings endpoint to:
- Extract all booking details from `special_instructions` JSON field
- Include contact information, vehicles, protection type, and destination details
- Properly map `booking_code` (display ID) and `database_id` (UUID) for each booking
- Add compatibility fields like `pickupDetails` and `timestamp`

#### 2. Fixed API Authentication
**File:** `app/api/bookings/route.ts`

Updated the GET endpoint to properly initialize the Supabase client using service role credentials, fixing the `createClient` undefined error.

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: New Booking Creation
1. Create a new booking from the mobile app or web interface
2. Verify that the client's actual name and email appear in the operator dashboard
3. Confirm it no longer shows as "test user"

### Test 2: Operator Actions
1. Open operator dashboard at www.protector.ng/operator
2. Select a pending booking
3. Click "Confirm" button
4. Verify the status updates successfully without 404 error
5. Test other actions (Send Invoice, Deploy Team, etc.)

### Test 3: Booking Details
1. Check that all booking details are properly displayed:
   - Client name and contact info
   - Service type
   - Pickup and destination addresses
   - Vehicle requirements
   - Personnel requirements

---

## Database Changes Required

No database schema changes are required. The fixes work with the existing database structure.

However, you may want to:
1. Review existing bookings with the default test client ID
2. Optionally migrate them to proper client profiles if you have the contact information

---

## Deployment Notes

### Files Changed:
1. `app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Booking creation and retrieval
2. `components/operator-dashboard.tsx` - Operator action handling
3. `app/api/operator/bookings/route.ts` - Operator bookings endpoint

### No Breaking Changes:
All changes are backward compatible with existing bookings.

### Environment Variables:
No new environment variables required. The fixes use existing Supabase credentials.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** "Test user" issue - now shows actual client information
✅ **Fixed:** 404 error on operator confirm action
✅ **Improved:** Booking data extraction and display
✅ **No linter errors:** All TypeScript errors resolved

The live domain (www.protector.ng) should now work correctly with real client data and functional operator actions.
