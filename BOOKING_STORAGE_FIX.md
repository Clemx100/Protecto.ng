# 📋 User Bookings Storage & Display Fix

## 🐛 Problems Identified

1. **Pending bookings not showing** - The active bookings filter excluded 'pending' status
2. **Bookings not refreshing** - After creating a booking, the list wasn't updated
3. **No auto-refresh on tab switch** - Switching to bookings tab didn't reload data
4. **Poor logging** - Hard to debug booking creation issues

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Include Pending Bookings in Active List

**Before:**
```typescript
.in('status', ['accepted', 'en_route', 'arrived', 'in_service'])
```

**After:**
```typescript
.in('status', ['pending', 'accepted', 'en_route', 'arrived', 'in_service'])
```

**Impact**: New bookings with 'pending' status now appear in the Active Bookings list ✅

### 2. Auto-Refresh After Booking Creation

**Added:**
```typescript
await storeBookingInSupabase(payload)
await loadBookings() // Refresh the list!
```

**Impact**: New booking appears immediately in the bookings list ✅

### 3. Auto-Refresh on Tab Switch

**Added:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab === 'bookings' && user?.id) {
    loadBookings()
  }
}, [activeTab, user?.id])
```

**Impact**: Bookings always fresh when you switch to the bookings tab ✅

### 4. Comprehensive Logging

**Added logging for**:
- User authentication status
- Booking payload details
- Session token availability
- API response details
- Client ID verification
- Bookings query results
- Load counts and errors

**Impact**: Easy to debug any booking issues ✅

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Create a Booking

1. **Login** to the app
2. **Book a Protector** (go through the booking flow)
3. **Check console** - Should see:
   ```
   👤 Creating booking for user: { userId: "xxx", email: "user@example.com" }
   🔐 Session found, token available: true
   📤 Submitting booking via API with user: xxx
   ✅ Booking created successfully via API: { bookingId: "uuid", clientId: "xxx", status: "pending" }
   🔄 Refreshing bookings list...
   📥 Loading bookings for user: xxx
   📊 Active bookings query result: { count: 1, error: null }
   ✅ Bookings loaded: { active: 1, history: 0 }
   ```

4. **Navigate to chat** (automatically)
5. **Go back to app** and click "Bookings" tab
6. **Expected**: See your new booking in the "Active" section ✅

### Test 2: Verify Correct User Assignment

1. **Create a booking**
2. **Check console** for:
   ```
   ✅ Booking created successfully via API: { ..., clientId: "your-user-id" }
   ```
3. **Should NOT see**:
   ```
   ⚠️ WARNING: Booking created with different user ID!
   ```
4. **Expected**: No warnings = correct user assignment ✅

### Test 3: Verify Database Storage

Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Check recent bookings
SELECT 
  id,
  booking_code,
  client_id,
  status,
  pickup_address,
  created_at,
  (SELECT email FROM profiles WHERE id = bookings.client_id) as client_email
FROM bookings
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected**:
- See your booking
- `client_id` matches your user ID
- `status` is 'pending'
- All fields populated ✅

### Test 4: Tab Switching Refresh

1. **Go to Protector tab**
2. **Switch to Bookings tab**
3. **Check console**:
   ```
   📑 Bookings tab opened, refreshing...
   📥 Loading bookings for user: xxx
   ```
4. **Expected**: Bookings always up-to-date ✅

## 📊 Booking Status Flow

```
User creates booking
    ↓
Status: "pending" (shows in Active Bookings)
    ↓
Operator accepts
    ↓
Status: "accepted" (still in Active Bookings)
    ↓
Operator deploys team
    ↓
Status: "en_route" (still in Active Bookings)
    ↓
Team arrives
    ↓
Status: "arrived" (still in Active Bookings)
    ↓
Service starts
    ↓
Status: "in_service" (still in Active Bookings)
    ↓
Service completes
    ↓
Status: "completed" (moves to History)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No active bookings" but I just created one

**Check:**
1. Open browser console
2. Look for:
   ```
   ✅ Booking created successfully via API
   📊 Active bookings query result: { count: 0 or 1 }
   ```

**If count is 0**:
- Verify user is logged in
- Check `client_id` in database matches your user ID
- Run SQL query from Test 3 above

**If count is 1 but not showing**:
- Check `transformBookings` function
- Look for JavaScript errors in console

### Issue: Booking shows wrong user name

**Check:**
1. Verify you're logged in with correct account
2. Check console for:
   ```
   ⚠️ WARNING: Booking created with different user ID!
   ```

**Fix:**
- The API should now properly use your session
- Make sure you're authenticated before booking
- Check `app/api/bookings/route.ts` is using cookies correctly

### Issue: Booking disappears after page refresh

**Check:**
1. Verify booking exists in database (SQL query above)
2. Check `loadBookings()` is being called
3. Look for errors in console

**Fix:**
- If in database but not loading, check RLS policies
- If not in database, check booking creation API

## 🎯 Expected Results

After these fixes:

✅ **New bookings appear immediately** in Active Bookings  
✅ **Pending status is visible** (not hidden)  
✅ **Correct user name** displayed
