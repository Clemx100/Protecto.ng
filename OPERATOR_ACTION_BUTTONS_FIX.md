# ✅ Operator Action Buttons After Invoice - FIXED

## 🐛 Issue

**Problem:** After operator sends an invoice, the "Send Invoice" button kept appearing. The operator could send multiple invoices, which was confusing.

**User Report:** "the action button doesn't show any other action button after send invoice"

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **What Changed:**

1. ✅ Added `hasInvoice` parameter to `getStatusActions()` function
2. ✅ Check if invoice message exists in chat before showing action buttons
3. ✅ Hide "Send Invoice" button after invoice is sent
4. ✅ Show "Waiting for Payment" status indicator instead
5. ✅ Once payment is received, show "Deploy Team" button

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

**File:** `components/operator-dashboard.tsx`

### **1. Updated `getStatusActions` Function (Lines 961-1012)**

**Before:**
```typescript
const getStatusActions = (status: string, hasPaymentApproved: boolean = false) => {
  // ...
  case 'accepted':
  case 'confirmed':
    if (hasPaymentApproved) {
      return [{ action: 'deploy', label: 'Deploy Team', ... }]
    } else {
      return [{ action: 'invoice', label: 'Send Invoice', ... }]  // ❌ Always shows!
    }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const getStatusActions = (status: string, hasPaymentApproved: boolean = false, hasInvoice: boolean = false) => {
  // ...
  case 'accepted':
  case 'confirmed':
    if (hasPaymentApproved) {
      return [{ action: 'deploy', label: 'Deploy Team', ... }]
    } else if (hasInvoice) {
      // Invoice sent, waiting for payment - no action buttons
      return []  // ✅ Hide buttons after invoice sent
    } else {
      return [{ action: 'invoice', label: 'Send Invoice', ... }]
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Updated Function Call (Lines 1338-1342)**

**Before:**
```typescript
{getStatusActions(selectedBooking.status, paymentApproved[selectedBooking.id]).map(...)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{getStatusActions(
  selectedBooking.status, 
  paymentApproved[selectedBooking.id],
  messages.some(msg => msg.has_invoice || msg.message_type === 'invoice')  // ✅ Check for invoice
).map(...)}
```

---

### **3. Added "Waiting for Payment" Indicator (Lines 1365-1383)**

**New Code:**
```typescript
{paymentApproved[selectedBooking.id] ? (
  <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-green-500/20 border border-green-500/50 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
      <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-green-400 rounded-full"></div>
      <span className="text-green-300 text-sm font-medium">Payment Approved</span>
    </div>
  </div>
) : messages.some(msg => msg.has_invoice || msg.message_type === 'invoice') && 
    (selectedBooking.status === 'accepted' || selectedBooking.status === 'confirmed') ? (
  <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-yellow-500/20 border border-yellow-500/50 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
      <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-yellow-400 rounded-full animate-pulse"></div>
      <span className="text-yellow-300 text-sm font-medium">Waiting for Payment</span>
    </div>
    <div className="text-xs text-yellow-200 mt-1">
      Invoice sent - awaiting client payment confirmation
    </div>
  </div>
) : null}
```

## 🎯 Updated Operator Flow

### **Before Fix:**
```
1. Booking status: PENDING
2. Operator clicks "Send Invoice" → Invoice sent
3. Booking status: ACCEPTED
4. ❌ "Send Invoice" button still shows (operator can send multiple invoices!)
5. Operator confused - no way to deploy team
```

### **After Fix:**
```
1. Booking status: PENDING
2. Operator clicks "Send Invoice" → Invoice sent
3. Booking status: ACCEPTED
4. ✅ "Send Invoice" button disappears
5. ✅ "Waiting for Payment" indicator shows (with pulsing dot)
6. Client pays → Payment verified
7. ✅ "Deploy Team" button appears
8. Operator clicks "Deploy Team" → Status changes to EN_ROUTE
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Test Case 1: Send Invoice Flow**

**Steps:**
1. Log in as operator
2. Select a booking with status "PENDING" or "ACCEPTED"
3. Click "Send Invoice"
4. Fill in invoice details
5. Click "Send Invoice" in modal

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Invoice appears in chat
- ✅ "Send Invoice" button disappears
- ✅ "Waiting for Payment" indicator shows with yellow pulsing dot
- ✅ No other action buttons visible

---

### **Test Case 2: After Payment Received**

**Steps:**
1. Client pays via Paystack
2. Payment is verified (status → PAID)
3. Operator refreshes or booking updates

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ "Waiting for Payment" indicator disappears
- ✅ "Payment Approved" indicator shows (green)
- ✅ "Deploy Team" button appears
- ✅ Operator can click to deploy

---

### **Test Case 3: Before Invoice Sent**

**Steps:**
1. Log in as operator
2. Select a booking with status "ACCEPTED"
3. No invoice sent yet

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ "Send Invoice" button shows
- ✅ No "Waiting for Payment" indicator

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Invoice Detection:**

The system checks if an invoice exists by:
```typescript
messages.some(msg => msg.has_invoice || msg.message_type === 'invoice')
```

**Checks:**
1. `msg.has_invoice` - Boolean flag on message
2. `msg.message_type === 'invoice'` - Message type field

**Why Both?** Different parts of the system set different fields, so we check both for reliability.

---

### **Status Conditions:**

"Waiting for Payment" shows when:
1. ✅ Invoice message exists in chat
2. ✅ Booking status is "accepted" or "confirmed"
3. ✅ Payment NOT yet approved

"Payment Approved" shows when:
1. ✅ `paymentApproved[bookingId]` is true
2. OR booking status is "paid"
3. OR booking has `payment_approved: true`

---

## ✅ Verification

### **Linting:**
```bash
✅ No linter errors
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ All syntax valid
```

### **Safety:**
```bash
✅ No breaking changes
✅ Backward compatible
✅ Existing flows preserved
✅ Only affects accepted status with invoice
```

### **User Experience:**
```bash
✅ Clear visual feedback
✅ No confusing duplicate buttons
✅ Status indicators guide next steps
✅ Pulsing animation draws attention
```

---

## 🎉 Result

**Operator Experience:** ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**

Operators now have:
- ✅ Clear action buttons that appear at the right time
- ✅ Visual feedback on payment status
- ✅ No confusion about duplicate invoices
- ✅ Smooth flow from invoice → payment → deployment

**No more confusion!** 🚀
