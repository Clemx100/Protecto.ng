# 💰 Invoice Sending Fix - Complete Solution

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Symptom**: Operator sends invoice, but it keeps disappearing from the chat

**Root Cause**: 
The invoice was only being saved to `localStorage` but **NOT to the database**. When messages were refreshed from the database, the invoice disappeared because it was never persisted.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Updated `sendInvoice` Function** (operator-dashboard.tsx)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only saved to localStorage ❌
localStorage.setItem(`chat_${selectedBooking.id}`, JSON.stringify(allMessages))
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Now sends to database via API ✅
const response = await fetch('/api/operator/messages', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    bookingId: databaseId,
    content: invoiceContent,
    messageType: 'invoice',
    metadata: invoiceWithCurrency // Stores invoice data
  })
})
```

### 2. **Enhanced Operator Messages API** (app/api/operator/messages/route.ts)

**Added**:
- Accept `metadata` parameter for invoice data
- Store metadata in database (with fallback)
- Return invoice data in GET responses
- Proper invoice message type handling

### 3. **Added Database Support** (scripts/add-messages-metadata.sql)

**Creates**:
- `metadata` JSONB column for storing invoice data
- `invoice_data` JSONB column as fallback
- Indexes for quick invoice queries

### 4. **Real-Time Invoice Handling** (operator-dashboard.tsx)

**Updated**:
- Real-time subscription now includes invoice data
- Messages loaded from API include invoice data
- Invoice data preserved across refreshes

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add Database Column

Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Add metadata column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Add invoice_data column as fallback
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS invoice_data JSONB DEFAULT NULL;

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_messages_invoice 
ON messages(booking_id) WHERE message_type = 'invoice';

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_messages_metadata 
ON messages USING gin(metadata);
```

Or use the provided script:
```bash
# Copy content from scripts/add-messages-metadata.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and run
```

### Step 2: Test Invoice Sending

1. Open operator dashboard
2. Select a booking
3. Click "Send Invoice"
4. Fill in pricing details
5. Click "Send Invoice" button
6. **Expected**: Invoice appears in chat ✅
7. Refresh the page
8. **Expected**: Invoice still there ✅

### Step 3: Verify in Database

```sql
-- Check invoice messages
SELECT 
  id,
  booking_id,
  message_type,
  metadata,
  invoice_data,
  content,
  created_at
FROM messages
WHERE message_type = 'invoice'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see:
- `message_type` = 'invoice'
- `metadata` contains invoice pricing data
- `content` contains formatted invoice text

## 📊 Invoice Data Structure

The invoice is now stored in the `metadata` column as:

```json
{
  "basePrice": 100000,
  "hourlyRate": 25000,
  "vehicleFee": 15000,
  "personnelFee": 30000,
  "duration": 24,
  "totalAmount": 745000,
  "currency": "NGN"
}
```

## 🎨 How Invoice Appears

### In Operator Dashboard:
```
📄 Invoice for Your Protection Service

**Service Details:**
• Base Price: ₦100,000
• Hourly Rate (24h): ₦600,000
• Vehicle Fee: ₦15,000
• Personnel Fee: ₦30,000

**Total Amount: ₦745,000**

Please review and approve the payment to proceed.
```

### In Client Chat:
The invoice message will include an "Approve & Pay" button (already implemented in the operator dashboard view).

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open operator dashboard
- [ ] Select a booking
- [ ] Click "Send Invoice"
- [ ] Enter pricing details
- [ ] Click "Send Invoice" button
- [ ] Invoice appears in chat ✅
- [ ] Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
- [ ] Invoice still visible ✅
- [ ] Check client chat
- [ ] Invoice visible to client ✅
- [ ] Check database
- [ ] Invoice record exists ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Invoice still disappearing

**Check 1**: Verify metadata column exists
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'messages' AND column_name IN ('metadata', 'invoice_data');
```

**Check 2**: Check browser console for errors
```
Should see:
✅ Invoice message saved to database: msg_abc123

Should NOT see:
❌ Failed to create message
❌ Column "metadata" does not exist
```

**Check 3**: Verify API response
```javascript
// In browser console after sending invoice
// Should return success with invoice data
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    id: "...",
    message_type: "invoice",
    metadata: { basePrice: 100000, ... }
  }
}
```

### Issue: Invoice displays but no pricing data

**Fix**: The `metadata` or `invoice_data` column is missing. Run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

### Issue: Old invoices not showing

**Explanation**: Old invoices in localStorage won't have database IDs. They need to be re-sent.

**Solution**: Re-send the invoice after applying the fix.
