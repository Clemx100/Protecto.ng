# Fix CORS Issue - Registration Working in Server but Failing in Browser

## Problem Identified ✅
- **Server-side registration**: ✅ Working (Node.js can register users)
- **Browser registration**: ❌ Failing (CORS blocking requests)
- **Error**: "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again."

## Root Cause
Your Supabase project has **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** restrictions that are blocking browser requests from `http://localhost:3000`.

## Solution: Fix Supabase CORS Settings

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kifcevffaputepvpjpip

### 2. Update CORS Settings
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in left sidebar
2. Click **API** tab
3. Look for **CORS** or **Allowed Origins** section
4. Add these origins:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   http://127.0.0.1:3000
   https://your-domain.com (if deployed)
   ```
5. Click **Save**

### 3. Alternative: Disable CORS (Development Only)
If you can't find CORS settings:
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Look for **Site URL** or **Redirect URLs**
3. Add: `http://localhost:3000`
4. Save changes

### 4. Check Project Configuration
Make sure your project:
- ✅ Is **Active** (not paused)
- ✅ Has **proper billing** (if on paid plan)
- ✅ Has **CORS properly configured**

## Alternative: Temporary Workaround

If you can't access Supabase settings right now, I can modify the app to use a different approach:

### Option 1: Server-Side Registration
Create an API endpoint that handles registration on the server side.

### Option 2: Proxy Requests
Route registration through your Next.js API routes to bypass CORS.

## Test After Fix

Once you've updated CORS settings:

1. **Restart your dev server**:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
   - Clear cached images and files

3. **Try registration again**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/client
   - Try to register
   - Should work now!

## Quick Test

Run this to verify CORS is fixed:
```bash
node debug-registration.js
```

Should show "✅ SIGNUP SUCCESS!" and then registration in browser should work too.

## If Still Not Working

### Check Browser Console
1. Press `F12` in browser
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Try registration
4. Look for CORS-related errors like:
   - "Access to fetch at 'https://...' has been blocked by CORS policy"
   - "Cross-Origin Request Blocked"

### Common CORS Error Messages
- "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" missing
- "Preflight request" failed
- "CORS policy" blocking request

## Need Help?

If you can't find the CORS settings in Supabase:
1. Check if you have admin access to the project
2. Look for **API Keys** or **Configuration** sections
3. Contact Supabase support if settings are missing
